## ⚙️ Technology Stack

Below is an overview of the technologies used in this project and their specific purposes:

### 🔹 Django
- **Purpose**: A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable web applications. It handles routing, views, models, and admin functionalities, forming the foundation of the backend.

### 🔹 Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Purpose**: An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. It provides serializers, viewsets, and routing for handling HTTP requests and responses.

### 🔹 PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and query structured data, including users, properties, bookings, and reviews.

### 🔹 GraphQL
- **Purpose**: A flexible query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving frontend performance.

### 🔹 Celery
- **Purpose**: An asynchronous task queue used for background job processing such as sending notifications, booking confirmations, and payment handling.

### 🔹 Redis
- **Purpose**: An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing Celery task queues to improve performance.

### 🔹 Docker
- **Purpose**: A containerization platform that ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments. It simplifies dependency management and deployment.

### 🔹 CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- **Purpose**: Automated workflows that test, build, and deploy code changes. Ensures quality and speeds up the release cycle.
