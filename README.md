# 🏠 AirBnB Clone Project

## 🚀 Objective

The backend for the AirBnB Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend supports the core features required to mimic the Airbnb platform, ensuring a smooth experience for both users and hosts.

---

## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and profile handling.
- **Property Management**: Endpoints to create, update, retrieve, and delete listings.
- **Booking System**: Book and manage stays, including check-in/out flows.
- **Payment Processing**: Seamless and secure handling of transactions.
- **Review System**: Enable users to review and rate properties.
- **Data Optimization**: Efficient data access through indexing and caching.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

The AirBnB Clone backend is designed to replicate core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. Below are the major features and what each one brings to the project:

### 1. **User Management**
Handles the registration, authentication, and profile management of users. This feature ensures that both guests and hosts can securely access and manage their accounts.

### 2. **Property Management**
Allows hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature enables hosts to manage accommodations that are available for booking.

### 3. **Booking System**
Enables users to reserve available properties for specified date ranges. It handles the creation and modification of bookings, ensuring accurate availability tracking and preventing double bookings.

### 4. **Payment Processing**
Facilitates secure payment transactions related to bookings. It manages the recording of payments, tracks statuses (pending, completed), and integrates with third-party payment services if needed.

### 5. **Review System**
Allows users to leave ratings and feedback on properties they have booked. This builds trust within the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### 6. **API Access (REST & GraphQL)**
Provides access to backend functionality through RESTful endpoints and GraphQL queries. This allows frontend applications to interact with the backend in a flexible and structured manner.

### 7. **Performance Optimization**
Implements indexing, caching, and asynchronous processing to ensure the application remains responsive and scalable under high load.


## ⚙️ Technology Stack

Below is an overview of the technologies used in this project and their specific purposes:

### 🔹 Django
- **Purpose**: A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable web applications. It handles routing, views, models, and admin functionalities, forming the foundation of the backend.

### 🔹 Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Purpose**: An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. It provides serializers, viewsets, and routing for handling HTTP requests and responses.

### 🔹 PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and query structured data, including users, properties, bookings, and reviews.

### 🔹 GraphQL
- **Purpose**: A flexible query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving frontend performance.

### 🔹 Celery
- **Purpose**: An asynchronous task queue used for background job processing such as sending notifications, booking confirmations, and payment handling.

### 🔹 Redis
- **Purpose**: An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing Celery task queues to improve performance.

### 🔹 Docker
- **Purpose**: A containerization platform that ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments. It simplifies dependency management and deployment.

### 🔹 CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- **Purpose**: Automated workflows that test, build, and deploy code changes. Ensures quality and speeds up the release cycle.
